Bitcoin climbed to an all-time high as Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election along with pro-crypto candidates being voted to Congress spurred expectations of a light-handed regulatory environment. 
The dollar traded not far from last week's four-month peak versus major peers as traders prepared for a key reading of U.S. consumer inflation this week, as well as a parade of Federal Reserve speakers, including Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng (.HSI) tumbled 2.5% as of 0200 GMT, with a sub-index of mainland Chinese property shares tumbling 3.9%. Chinese blue chips (.CSI300) weakened 0.3%. 
Japan's Nikkei (.N225) fell 0.3%. South Korea's Kospi (.KS11) lost 0.9% and Taiwan's benchmark (.TWII) slipped 0.7%. 
Australia's share benchmark (.AXJO) declined 0.4%, weighed down by commodity stocks, after oil and industrial metals weakened. 
On Friday, after Chinese markets had closed, the National People's Congress Standing Committee unveiled a 10 trillion yuan ($1.39 trillion) debt package to ease local government financing strains and stabilise flagging economic growth. 
However, the stimulus steps lacked the direct injection of money into the economy that some investors had hoped to see, particularly amid the threat of massive tariffs under the incoming Trump administration. 
""It may be disappointing for those who were expecting the NPC meeting to approve a massive fiscal package, but the expectation is unrealistic, because the policy goal is to achieve the GDP growth target and reduce tail risks, not to reflate the economy in any meaningful way,"" Macquarie analysts wrote in a note. 
""China's policy will also only respond to its own economic conditions, not the U.S. election result."" 
The stimulus disappointment, however, overshadowed what should have been a positive lead from Wall Street, where the S&P 500 (.SPX) broke above 6,000 points for the first time before closing at a record slightly below that level. 
S&P 500 futures pointed 0.2% higher on Monday. 
The Republican party is edging closer to sweeping both chambers of Congress, taking the Senate on election night and with Edison Research projecting it so far to have 214 seats of the 218 seats needed for control of the House, compared to 205 for Democrats. 
Investors expect that Trump's second term in office will bring equities-boosting tax cuts and looser regulations. 
Bitcoin , which has been another prominent ""Trump trade"", extended its record run to mark a fresh all-time high of $81,756. 
Trump has pledged to make the United States ""the crypto capital of the planet"". 
The dollar index , which measures the currency against six major peers, held steady at 105.01 following Friday's 0.55% climb. 
Traders will be watching consumer price data on Wednesday for stickiness that could scupper the chances of an interest rate cut at the next meeting in December. 
Markets currently lay about 65% odds for a quarter-point reduction on Dec. 18, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. 
The dollar rose 0.5% to 153.39 yen , reversing some of the weakness from Friday, when the pair tracked long-term U.S. Treasury yields lower . 
Minutes of the Bank of Japan's October policy meetings showed officials were divided on how soon they could raise rates again, though market reaction was muted. 
U.S. bond markets are closed on Monday for Veterans Day, although Wall Street will be open. 
The euro was flat at $1.0721, sitting not far from a four-month low. Political uncertainty remained a drag as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he would be willing to call a vote of confidence before Christmas, paving the way for snap elections following the collapse of his governing coalition. 
Sterling was little changed at $1.2922. 
Gold declined 0.5% to $2,669.69 per ounce, dropping back further from last month's record high of $2,790.15. 
Base metals in Shanghai slipped, with the most-traded December copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) falling 0.9% to 76,570 yuan a ton. 
Oil prices extended declines from Friday, when Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) each sank more than 2%. On Monday, Brent futures dropped 0.3% to $73.68 a barrel, while U.S. WTI futures lost 0.4% to $70.13 a barrel.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index (.GSPTSE) was down 86.53 points, or 0.35%, at 24,759.40. The pullback came as the index closed higher for the week after two straight weeks of declines, broadly benefiting from Donald Trump's reelection in the United States and his proposals for tax cuts and looser regulations on corporations. 
However, his planned 10% tariff on all imports could have serious implications for Canada, the world's No. 4 crude oil producer. 
Canada's materials sector (.GSPTTMT) fell 1.9% as gold prices logged their steepest weekly decline in over five months, pressured by a stronger dollar and uncertainty about Trump's victory's impact on the U.S. rate cut trajectory 
Lower copper prices also weighed on the sector as China's latest fiscal stimulus disappointed investors. 
Among top losers were Sandstorm Gold (SSL.TO) , Ivanhoe Mines (IVN.TO) and First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) that fell between 7% and 9%. 
The energy sector (.SPTTEN) fell 1.1%, tracking oil prices as concerns eased over Hurricane Rafael's impact on the U.S. Gulf's oil and gas infrastructure. 
Canada added lower-than-expected 14,500 jobs in October, while wages of permanent employees rose. The unemployment rate stayed unchanged from September but hovered around a 34-month high of 6.5%. 
Traders see a 60% chance of a 50-bps cut at the Bank of Canada's December policy meeting, slightly below the 64% likelihood seen before the data. 
BoC's peer, the U.S. Federal Reserve, cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday. 
""Potentially, the Fed is going to have a slower and shallower rate cutting path relative to the Bank of Canada and other central banks that will apply some upward pressure on the dollar and therefore weigh on some of these commodity prices,"" Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones said. 
The biggest gainer on the index, Mattr (MATR.TO) , jumped 16% after the material technology company agreed to buy power cable producer AmerCable from France-based Nexans (NEXS.PA) for $280 million."
https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/commodities-weaken-amid-heightened-risks-trumps-second-term-russell-2024-11-06/,Commodities weaken amid heightened risks from Trump's second term | Reuters,Commodities weaken amid heightened risks from Trump's second term,2024-11-07T13:00:00Z,"Commodities, US Elections, Grid & Infrastructure, LNG, OPEC",Clyde Russell,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Commodities reacted with trepidation to the election of Donald Trump to a second term as U.S. President, with most losing ground over fears the global economy will be hit by a new tariff war. 
The downbeat reaction was in stark contrast to U.S. equities, which surged to record highs amid optimism that Trump's agenda of lower taxes will boost growth, at least in the United States. 
The contrasting response to Trump's victory over Democrat nominee and now outgoing U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris showed exactly why the likely impacts of Trump's return to the White House are hard to assess. 
Take crude oil for example. 
The world's most important commodity dipped when it became clear that Trump would prevail in Tuesday's vote, with global benchmark Brent futures dropping as much as 2.9% during Wednesday's trade, before ending the down 0.5% at $75.16 a barrel. 
In theory, Trump's energy policies should be somewhat bearish for global oil prices, as he is in favour of loosening regulation of the sector in the United Stares, and encouraging even higher output in the world's biggest crude producer. 
In practice, U.S. oil output may not move much higher, given it is already at record levels and companies will be wary about boosting production if they believe the impact will be to weaken prices further. 
Trump has also promised to bring peace to the Middle East, without specifying how this will be accomplished. 
But on the assumption he is able to convince Israel to end its conflict with Iran and the groups it supports, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, this would be bearish for oil prices as the geopolitical risk premium would dissipate. 
Trump's affinity for Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and another unspecified promise to end the Ukraine conflict, may also result in easing sanctions against Russia, which in turn may boost its exports of crude oil and other energy products such as liquefied natural gas and coal. 
On the other hand, Trump has made it clear he aims to go hard against Iran, and may try to tighten sanctions against Tehran, which in turn may make it slightly harder for Iran to sell its crude. 
Trump's plan to impose tariffs of 10%-20% on all U.S. imports, and up to 60% from those from China, is also likely to hurt crude prices, given it would likely curtail global trade, leading to slower economic growth and the risk of higher inflation and interest rates. 
Overall, the main risks for crude appear to be to the downside, complicating the task for OPEC and its allies in the wider OPEC+ group to set a production policy that tries to keep prices high enough, without the group having to give up too much market share. 
LNG is another commodity that in theory may face a more bearish outlook under Trump, given his support for expanding U.S. production and the construction of new export plants. 
But again, much will depend on Trump's trade policy. 
If comprehensive tariffs are placed on all imports into the United States, it's likely that countries will respond with tit-for-tat tariffs on their imports of U.S. goods. 
This means that U.S. LNG, and indeed crude oil and coal, may cost more than alternatives, meaning that U.S. producers may have to discount prices to remain competitive, or hope that tariffs aren't placed on their products. 
The prospects for industrial metals appear bleaker than for energy commodities, especially since they are more exposed to China, the world's biggest buyer of copper and iron ore. 
London copper contracts slumped 4.1% on Wednesday, ending at $9,343 a metric ton, the weakest close in nearly two months. 
Singapore iron ore futures fared somewhat better, but still ended down 1.2% at $104.16 a ton, while zinc contracts in London dropped 4.2% to $2,973 a ton. 
Iron ore is the key raw material used to make steel, while zinc is mainly used to galvanise steel. 
Both are heavily exposed to China, and therefore face the prospect of lower demand if exports from the world's second-biggest economy are hit by Trump's planned tariffs, and the likely accompanying slowdown and re-ordering of global trade. 
Another commodity that is likely to play a wait and watch game is gold, with the spot price dropping 3.1% on Wednesday to end at $2,659.24 an ounce. 
The decline was largely because of a surging U.S. dollar, but gold also faces contradictory pressures from a Trump presidency. 
Higher bond yields and interest rates, caused by Trump's likely inflationary tariffs and tax cuts, will cut the appeal of gold. 
But the precious metal may also benefit from the possible volatility of a Trump presidency, which may heighten geopolitical risk and encourage investors to diversify assets. 
Overall, Trump's second term comes with more downside risks for commodities, but much will depend on how much of his economic and political agenda he is able to implement, and how quickly it is done.

China's gold holdings stood at 72.8 million troy ounces at the end of last month. The value of the gold reserves, however, rose to $199.06 billion from $191.47 billion at the end of September. 
Bullion prices have surged about 33% this year, on track for the largest annual gain since 1979, driven by the start of U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut cycle, geopolitical tensions, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Presidential election, and strong demand from central banks. 
According to the World Gold Council, gold purchases by global central banks, active in 2022-2023, are set to decelerate in 2024 but remain above pre-2022 levels. This is partly due to the People's Bank of China (PBOC) pausing its 18-month buying streak in May. 
""Another month of China refraining from buying indicates the PBOC is looking for a better price to build its gold reserves. We don’t think China has changed its foreign exchange reserve strategy and so is looking for more gold, but deterred by the higher prices,"" Nitesh Shah, commodity strategist at WisdomTree, said. 
The share of gold in the PBOC's overall reserves, a key gauge of many central banks' holdings for gold, reached 5.7% at the end of October vs 4.9% at the of April. 
This week's meeting of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress is in the spotlight as investors look for further details on fiscal stimulus measures."

The benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index (.GSPTSE) closed up 257.43 points, or 1.06%, at 24,645.33, helped by financials, tech and industrial stocks. 
Trump, a Republican, was elected after defeating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. The win propelled a global stock market rally, while investors also evaluated the impact of Trump's second term on the world economy. 
Trump's proposed measures, most notably tariff hikes, could be of great consequence to Toronto's commodities-heavy market. Trump has promised to shift U.S. policy toward oil and away from green energy, which could disrupt demand for metals such as copper. 
The United States is the largest buyer of Canada's energy products. 
Among commodities, metals fell the most, with gold hitting a three-week low and copper posting its biggest intraday loss in five months. 
Canada's materials sector (.GSPTTMT) led sectoral losses and closed down 1.77%, weighed down by copper and gold prices. 
However, gold miners said they were confident that the fall in the commodity prices was temporary. 
""If we see the global markets, everyone seems to be pulling away from one another and I think the protectionism probably leads to many countries backing their own currencies with gold. If that is correct, gold will continue to have strong momentum,"" George Burns, CEO of Eldorado Gold (ELD.TO) , said. 
Information technology (.SPTTTK) led sectoral gains with a 3% jump, supported by Bitfarms (BITF.TO) , which climbed 18% following a boost to crypto stocks after the election results. 
Financials (.SPTTFS) , which have the biggest weighting on the index, gained 1.64%. The sector benefited from IA Financial (IAG.TO) , whose shares rose 11.4% after it beat third-quarter profit estimates. 
""A strong U.S. dollar has somewhat weighed on commodity prices,"" and is a ""notable drag on Canadian markets"", according to Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets."

Market participants were also looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision on Thursday for further clues on the bank's easing cycle that had helped gold's stunning rally to successive record highs this year. 
Spot gold was down 2.8% at $2,667.19 per ounce, as of 2:07 p.m. ET (1907 GMT), after hitting a three-week low of $2,652.19. The metal was on track to post its biggest daily loss in five months. 
U.S. gold futures settled 2.7% lower at $2,676.30. 
""A clear presidential victory when the market has been pricing in a contested result, removal of an element of risk, Trump trades include the dollar's strengthening this morning and the combination of the two has brought gold lower,"" said StoneX analyst Rhona O'Connell. 
Trump recaptured the White House by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, Edison Research projected. 
Investors said Trump's presidency will bolster the dollar, causing the Federal Reserve to pause its easing cycle if inflation takes off after expected new tariffs. 
The dollar index (.DXY) hit a four-month high, making bullion more expensive for overseas buyers. 
The risk of rising inflation could slow the pace of U.S. rate cuts as tariffs roll out, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. 
""The (Federal Open Market Committee) will likely still cut on Thursday but the subsequent language will be studied closely for signs of a pause."" 
Investors widely expect the Fed to announce a quarter-point rate cut after 50-bps reduction in September. 
Commodities from oil and gas to metals and grains dropped as the dollar rallied. 
Spot silver fell 4.4% to $31.24 per ounce. Platinum shed 0.8% to $991.60 and palladium was down 3.4% at $1,039.43. All three metals hit their lowest levels in three weeks."

Trump recaptured the White House by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, following a campaign of dark rhetoric that deepened the polarization in the country. 
Oil prices , flattened after falling by more than $2 per barrel earlier on a stronger dollar, with some analysts and investors saying the earlier decline was an over-reaction to the election results. 
Although Trump has long backed U.S. oil and gas production and could introduce heavy tariffs on imports which dampen economic growth and demand for fossil fuels, U.S. oil and gas production already hit record highs under former U.S. President Joe Biden, said Jacob Mandel at consultancy Aurora Energy Research. 
Benchmark European gas prices flattened out after rising slightly earlier. 
Agricultural commodities rebounded from earlier lows, with corn and wheat turning higher and soybeans paring losses on the back of sharply higher soyoil futures. 
A stronger dollar makes U.S. grain more expensive overseas and tariffs proposed by Trump could disrupt U.S. agricultural trade, particularly soybeans to leading importer China, which could retaliate with reduced purchases. 
But the peak U.S. soy export season is currently winding down so any impact from Chinese retaliation may not be felt until next summer. 
Also, Trump's promised tariff hikes on all imports could curb imports of used cooking oil by biofuels producers, boosting demand for domestically produced soyoil. 
Precious metals were still down, with gold prices at a three-week low on Wednesday, while copper lost nearly 4% and is set to post its biggest intraday loss in five months. 
For other metals, zinc became the worst performer of the base metals complex. The galvanising metal prices declined as China's steel industries could face headwinds as Trump pledged to boost local U.S. manufacturing. 
The copper market is pricing in the long-term direction of Trump's policies, a trader said. 
Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds"" under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Biden-Harris administration's signature climate law to decouple the global supply chain from China, which includes hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for electric vehicles, solar and wind energy, and increasing production of strategic minerals. 
""Gold will be torn between the risk of rising inflation, potentially slowing the pace of U.S. rate cuts, as tariffs are rolled out and continued demand for safe haven assets,"" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said. 
Commodity prices started to fall overnight as traders started to price in the likelihood of a Trump win. 
""This scenario is expected to bring about the promised tariffs on imported goods, particularly targeting China, potentially triggering a new wave of trade tensions and economic disruptions,"" Hansen added."

Best known for its charm bracelets, with prices ranging from $60 to more than $2,000, has been a rare bright spot among retailers and brands offering affordable luxury items. 
Pandora maintained a full-year 2024 operating margin goal of around 25% but said higher commodity prices could present a challenge to its 2026 margin goal of 26%-27%, adding that it was seeking to mitigate at least some of this with more price hikes. 
The company did not publish a 2025 margin goal. 
The price of silver has soared to around $32 per ounce from $22 in February, while gold has also risen. 
Pandora's operating profit rose to 980 million Danish crowns ($140.87 million) in the third quarter from 920 million a year earlier, slightly below the forecast of 991 million in a company-compiled poll. 
Shares in the company were down 5.2% at 0955 GMT, making them one of the worst performers in the pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) . 
The fall was likely caused by rising silver prices and the expected pressure on margins, rather than the third-quarter results, DNB Markets analyst Jesper Ingildsen said. 
""They increased prices in October, and they're going to increase prices again at the beginning of the year, is what they're saying. But nevertheless, it's probably not enough to fully offset that big increase in silver prices,"" he added. 
Pandora said it expects full-year organic operating profit growth of 11%-12%, compared to its previous range of 9-12%."

U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% lower at $2,746.20. 
The U.S. presidential election is on Tuesday, with opinion polls showing Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump neck and neck in the race to the White House. 
A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last month found worries that the U.S. could see a repeat of the unrest that followed Trump's 2020 election defeat, when his false claim that his loss was the result of fraud prompted hundreds to storm the U.S. Capitol. 
""If Trump wins, I think, gold does well here. We're probably worried a little bit more about inflation with all the tariffs that he's talking about,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities. 
Also on the radar this week is the Fed's interest rate decision on Thursday, with markets widely anticipating a quarter-point cut. 
Gold is seen as a hedge against economic and political uncertainty and tends to thrive when interest rates are low. 
""I guess the driver for gold this week will be U.S. elections. The Fed cut is unlikely to trigger much movements in my view, as the bank is likely to signal further cuts in line with market expectations,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. 
The dollar index (.DXY) was down 0.4%, hitting a two-week low. A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-priced gold more appealing for buyers holding other currencies. 
Spot silver rose 0.1% to $32.47 an ounce after touching a more than two-week low at $32.26, earlier in the session.
