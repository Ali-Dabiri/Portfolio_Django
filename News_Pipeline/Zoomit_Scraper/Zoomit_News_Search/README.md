# Zoomit News Search Spider

This is a Scrapy project that uses Selenium to scrape news data from [Zoomit.ir](https://www.zoomit.ir/), specifically from its news search section. The script extracts information such as news titles, publication dates, images, and estimated reading times from the search results page.
